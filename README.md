# Arukart

By [Alberto Fustinoni](http://aftnet.net)

The program was born as an attempt to replicating Mode 7 on the PS2 without using the Vector Units; as Mario Kart sprites were in ample supply at The Spriters Resource, the game quickly became an attempt at cloning it. After the engine was completed and basic gameplay implemented, I had to move on, so the program is little more than a tech demo.

After replicating Mode 7 on the hardware wasn’t going to be feasible, a primitive 3D rendering pipeline was instead implemented using only the main CPU (I couldn’t figure out how to use the VUs at the time).

The game is based on the PS2 application framework by Dr. Henry S. Fortuna. While it is a textbook example of “how not to use the PS2 to render 3D graphics”, as shown by the less than flattering frame rate, it is included here as it can be quite fun to play.

Audio tracks are from Pinball Fantasies and Pinball Illusions by FrontLine Design (better known as DICE nowadays).

## Controls
